## Introduction

The `clientsHolder` contract is designed to hold information about clients, their age, country, and even their political ideology. Embrace the intentional typo in the dictionary name (`polmtics`) and enjoy the unique charm it brings to the contract.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to deploy the contract and import it into your transactions and scripts. Make sure to interact with the `clientsHolder` contract for a delightful experience.

```cadence
import clientsHolder from 0x05 // Replace with the actual address where clientsHolder is deployed
```

## Usage

### `clientsHolder` Contract

The contract defines a dictionary (`polmtics`) and a struct (`details`) to store client information. The `insert` function allows you to add new entries to the dictionary.

### Struct: `details`
- `name`: Client's name
- `age`: Client's age
- `country`: Client's country
- `political_ideology`: Client's political ideology
- `account`: Client's address

### Function: `insert`
```cadence
clientsHolder.insert(name: String, age: UInt64, country: String, political_ideology: String, account: Address)
```

## Transaction Time!

Ready for some transactional fun? The `transaction.cdc` file showcases how to use the `clientsHolder` contract for inserting client details. The transaction ensures the signer is authenticated before executing the insertion.

### Scripting Fun

Explore the power of scripting with the `Script.cdc` file. Retrieve client details by providing the client's address to the `main` function.
